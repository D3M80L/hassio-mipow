It allows to integrate with MiPow Playbulbs - bluetooth, battery controlled LED candles.

## Verified devices:

## Version 3.0 - ALPHA.2
This version is not backward compatible.
We recommend to remove the entites and configuration that was configured for lower versions.

## Supported features
This integration requires [Home Assistant Bluetooth](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bluetooth/) integration.
The devices are discovered automatically or you can use MiPow integration from the integration list.
### Color light
In color mode you can control both white value and color separately.
When color is selected, the brigthness of the color is only changed, in this case the white value is controlled separately.
When no color is selected, then brightness represents white value.
